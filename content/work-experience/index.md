- Independently planned and deployed a 360-degree advertising-agency campaign and financial tracking system in Google Sheets that has served as the single source of truth since the company’s inception—drastically reduced campaign error rates and enabled profit forecasting insights whilst eliminating investments in tailored SAAS or Salesforce subscription alternatives.
