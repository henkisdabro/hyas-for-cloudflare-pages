## Hello! 👋🏼

I’m Henrik Söderlund, Media Activations Lead – Initiative Perth @ [KINESSO](https://kinesso.com). As ex-founder and technical lead of award-winning boutique media agency [Creme Digital](https://www.cremedigital.com?utm_source=www.henriksoderlund.com&utm_medium=referral) I bring deep experience in building and leading effective teams that manage RTB Programmatic, Search, Social, Mobile and Video advertising whilst injecting personal edge expertise in advanced ad performance tracking, measurement & server-side tagging/analytics.

Born a Swede, optimisation and problem-solving is in my genes, demonstrated in the fruition of agency performance tracking solutions, operational processes and SOPs. My wide-ranging technology- and systems skillset enables us to manage annual multi-million dollar media budgets with impressive accuracy whilst keeping operational expenditure to a minimum.
