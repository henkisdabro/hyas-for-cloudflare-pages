## Hello!👋🏼
I’m Henrik Soederlund, cofounder and technical lead of an award-winning boutique media agency [Creme Digital](https://www.cremedigital.com). I bring deep experience in building and leading effective teams that manage RTB, Search, Social, Mobile and Video advertising campaigns whilst bringing personal edge expertise in advanced ad performance tracking, measurement & analytics. 

Born a Swede, optimisation and problem-solving is in my genes, demonstrated in the fruition of agency performance tracking solutions, operational processes and SOPs. My wide-ranging technology- and systems skillset has enabled our company to manage annual media budgets north of AUD 3M with high accuracy, whilst keeping operational expenditure low.
